# Peterson-Sales-Company

This is a mockup of the website for Peterson Sales Company (full disclosure -- it is my dad's company). The company has a website already built at http://www.petersonsalescompany.com/. My sister, a graphic designer, built this functioning site using SquareSpace last year.

I, as a person who is learning to code, decided to try and rebuild that website from scratch, using the text editor Brackets and Twitter Bootstrap. I wanted to do this as a way to practice HTML/CSS/Bootstrap on a multi-page website, with many opportunities for using Bootstrap's column structure and various classes, while still adding plenty of my own styling/CSS. 

If anyone has any criticisms or ways for me to improve, I'd really appreciate it! Any advice is golden at this point in my very, very young career.
